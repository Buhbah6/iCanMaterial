        <h3>What is programming?</h3>
        <p>Programming is the process of writing code to create a program. A program is a set of instructions that a
            computer can follow to perform a task. A program can be anything from a simple calculator to a complex
            video game. Programming is a very useful skill to have, as it can be used to create many different things.
            Programming is also a very fun skill to have, as it can be used to create games, websites, and more!
