                    work collaboratively.
                    This is by far one of the most important things you can learn in software development, and as such,
                    future assignments will
                    need to be submitted through github. I will also show you your next assignment.

                    will be making a project
                    of your choice. I will be giving you a list of ideas to choose from, but you are free to come up
