                <h3><strong>Nov. 9th, 2023</strong></h3>
                <p>We'll be spending the afternoon reviewing data types from last
                    time, as well as a few important python methods. All the material will
                    be made available in the <a href="docs.html">Class Documents</a> page.
                    This information will be important because it'll show up on your first quiz! In Lesson 2, we'll be covering if/elif/else statements, boolean logic, and operators. This will be
                    important for your first assignment, so make sure you're familiar with the
                    material! I encourage you to try the exercises on your own before looking at the solutions!

                <h1><strong>Lesson 3 and Quiz 1</strong></h1>
                <h3><strong>Nov. 13th, 2023</strong></h3>
                <p> In Lesson 3, we'll be covering the lists data type, as well as an introduction to loops. We'll go
                    over it shortly and then you'll be
                    given a quiz on the material from lessons 1 and 2. After, I'll be giving you your assignment and
                    you'll have a week to complete it.
                    PLEASE READ THE ASSIGNMENT GUIDELINES CAREFULLY.

                <h3><strong>Nov. 16th, 2023</strong></h3>
                <p> I will be giving you the entire period to work on your Assignment 1. If you have completed it,
                    I have some practice problems for you to work on. (Hint: If you complete those you can do whatever
                    you want with the remaining time). If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me!

                <h3><strong>Nov. 20th, 2023</strong></h3>
                <p> In this lesson we'll continue with loops, and we'll be covering the while loop. We'll also be
                    covering the range() function, and how to use it to iterate through lists. Assignment 1 is due
                    today, so make sure you submit it before the lesson. While you guys are doing your practice problems
                    for the lesson
                    I'll be calling you up one by one to go over your assignment with you. If you have any questions
                    about the assignment,
                    please ask me before the lesson. Don't forget you can message me at any time on Teams and I'll do my
                    best to get back to you
                    as soon as possible!
