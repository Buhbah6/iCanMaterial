        <p>
            From this point forward we'll be working on developing user interfaces in Python with various tools
            with the goal of creating your own open source projects. Throughout the next few weeks you'll be learning
            how to
            make entire python applications from start to finish, and we'll cover some more complex OOP topics. You'll
            also learn
            what licences do, how to choose your license, and we'll be strongly reviewing git and github.

        <h3><strong>Dec. 18th, 2023</strong></h3>
        <p>Hi all, Today in iCan you'll be having a speaker present, and as such there won't be time for me to get
            through all your assignment submissions.
            That being said, I'm extending your assignment 3 to next Thursday at 2 PM. It gives you an extra couple of
            days to make sure everything works and it's up to the standards of
            the assignment document.

        <p>Hey Everyone, I've uploaded lessons 8, 9, and 10. They cover some important topics for your assignment 3.
            Please remember that assignment 3 is due on Dec. 18th at 2 PM. If you have any questions, or need any help,
            please message me on Teams. Also feel free to send me an invite to your GitHub repository if you make one.
            I can help manage merge conflicts and give you resources directly through there. My username on GitHub is

        <p>Hey Everyone, I've uploaded lessons 6 and 7 to the class documents. I've also uploaded the final version of
            the calendar,
            so please check that out as well. This is the last week of new material, so please make sure you're caught

            so please go look over that.
            Next class, we'll be learning about git, github, and I'll be giving you your second assignment. This one
            might be a bit on the tougher
            side so I <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommend you actively try to understand the material from lesson 3 and
