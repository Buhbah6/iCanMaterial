        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>I've been a programmer for several years now, learning languages such as Java, C#, C++, and Python. I've
            worked on several projects. I've made a few games, and I've also made a few websites. I've also worked on AI integration with PHP
            and the React.js framework
